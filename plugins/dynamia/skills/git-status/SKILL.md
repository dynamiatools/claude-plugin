description: Shows a compact, emoji-based status card for the git repo in the current directory (branch, last commit, working tree, main/master vs remote, pending PR, active issue and a to-do list). Read-only. Use when the user asks for the repo status, where things stand, or what is pending in the current branch.

# dynamia:git-status

Renders a compact status card (emojis, no ASCII borders) for the git repo in
the current working directory. Read-only: it never pushes, commits or creates
PRs.

## Steps

1. **Check the cwd is a git repo**:
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null
   ```
   If it fails, say "This directory is not a git repository" and stop.

2. **Branch and last commit**:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   git log -1 --format='%h %s%n%an%n%cr'
   basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
   ```

3. **Working tree**:
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   Summarize in one line (e.g. "3 modified, 1 untracked"). If clean, show
   "clean ✨".

4. **main/master vs remote** (best-effort; never block on network failures):
   ```bash
   git fetch origin --quiet 2>/dev/null
   ```
   Prefer `origin/main`, then `origin/master`. With whichever exists:
   ```bash
   git log -1 --format='%cr' origin/<base>
   git rev-list --left-right --count origin/<base>...HEAD
   ```
   The first gives when the remote last updated; the second gives
   "behind\tahead" for the current branch. Skip the ahead/behind comparison if
   the current branch IS the base branch. If no remote main/master exists,
   omit the line entirely.

5. **Pending PR** (uses `gh`; if unavailable or failing, show
   "— could not query" instead of failing the whole skill):
   ```bash
   gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)" --json number,title,baseRefName,url,statusCheckRollup,reviewDecision --limit 1
   ```
   If an open PR exists, show number, title, target branch and a checks
   summary (✅/❌/🟡 running). Include unresolved review threads only if `gh`
   exposes them simply; never invent data. No PR → "— none".

6. **Related issue**:
   - Use an issue referenced by the PR body ("Closes #N", "Fixes #N").
   - Otherwise infer from the branch name if it follows `feature/123-...`.
   - If found: `gh issue view <N> --json number,title,assignees` and show
     whether it is assigned to the current user.
   - If nothing can be inferred, show "— none". Do not guess.

7. **"Pending" section**, only when applicable:
   - "N unpushed commit(s)" (compare `HEAD` with `@{upstream}` if set).
   - "N unresolved PR comments" (if obtained in step 5).
   - "Failing PR checks" (if any check is ❌).
   If nothing is pending, show "✅ All up to date".

8. **Render the card** exactly in this format, omitting any line whose data
   does not apply or could not be obtained:

   ```
   📍 <repo-name> · branch <current-branch>

   📝 Last commit: <short-hash> <message>
      👤 <author> · 🕑 <relative-date>

   🌳 Working tree: <summary>

   🔄 <main-or-master>: origin updated <relative-date> · your branch is <N> behind / <N> ahead / up to date

   🔀 PR #<N> "<title>" → <target-branch>
      <✅/❌/🟡> <checks-summary> · 💬 <N> unresolved comments
      (or: 🔀 PR: — none)

   🎫 Issue #<N> "<title>" (assigned to you / unassigned)
      (or: 🎫 Issue: — none)

   ⚠️ Pending:
      • ...
      (or: ✅ All up to date)
   ```

## Notes

- Commands run in the cwd as-is; no fixed paths are assumed.
- If `gh` is not authenticated or the remote is not on GitHub, show the PR and
  issue blocks as "— could not query" and keep the rest of the card.
